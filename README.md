# vg-project-1
A short video-game demo, built entirely in python.
This is my first attempt making a more 'functional' video game - with menus, cutscenes, sound, text, etc.
I realized quickly that doing this in python is a little excessive. Or suicidal.
I transitioned to a more practical approach, and picked up a modern game engine. 
However, it gave me strong insight into the actually code that really just get reduced to 'object variables' in a game engine.

If I were to rehash this code, I would do it with better-defined enemy and player classes. This comes free in an engine and, 
after using one, I can see that this would be much easier to implement. Also, the code is really only optimized for my eyes, since I was using it as a study. In future, collaborative projects, I would comment and structure more effectively.
